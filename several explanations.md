# StoreSite
the site has been created using C#, .NET 5, MSSQL data base, Angular 12, bootstrap, 
ngx-toastr, Swagger UI
I may have forgotten something:)

The site is connected to a dataBase, you can fill the data base throgh the site, also you can edit the data base, delete existing information.

I whant to add this paragraph, to summarize the difficalties which  I had to go through:
1. installing MSSQL on my notebook. I have a spe—Åial version of windows, which doesn`t hase some files installed, needed for the MSSQL server, unfortenatly, I didn`t find the needed files, so I hade to install everything on my main computer, it prevented me from working on my project at home.
2.  Different version comflictations. While I was coding the backend of my project, I hade difficalties in creating a controller. It accured, that all of my packages, should be the latest, previously, I thought, that they should be the same version, as my .Net, it took a bit of time, but I have realized it in the end.
3. Migration. When I was almost done with the project, I understood, that i forgot to add the Item column, so I hade to go back and fix it, It took a bit of time, I hade to kill the old migration, and create another one, this also took me a bit of time... I will continue writing in a few hours
